### Cryptocurrencies


#### Project Overview 

The aim of this evaluation was meant to utilize data to showcase a report and visualize of traded cryptocurrencies that can be put together in making a new classification system. This report relied on accounting accountabilities that would aid rookies investment portfolio in the exciting world of cryptocurrency to its stakeholders. 

Due to the fact that, there are no know outcome, Machine Learning model will be used to allow us to execute a clustering algorithms to group the cryptocurrencies.

	* Dataset from [Crypto Compare](https://github.com/bwill09/Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/crypto_data.csv)
	* Software: Python 3.9.12 , Connda 4.14.0, Jupyter Notebooks 6.4.8
	* Libraries: Scikit-learn, Plotly, hvPlot, Pandas


#### We Applied

*	Data Preprocessing (Selection, Transformation, Scaling) â€“ this helps to prepare/process the data for Machine Learning Algorithms.
*	Elbow Curve - method to determine the best number of clusters needed for the algorithm to group the objects by.
*	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - statistical technique to speed up machine learning algorithms when the number of features is too high.
*	Clustering Algorithms (KMeans) - the process of grouping similar objects/data points into clusters.
*	Visualization (hvPlot, Plotly) - graphic libraries that allows us to create 2D and 3D graphs such as, scatter plots.
